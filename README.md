# Purrticles public samples and issues
This repo is the public storage of all samples and issues to do with the Purrticles app.

The repo was created to accompany Purrticles v1.0 because it has a developer focus and we want to make samples available as well as give you an [isssue tracker][p2] for adding requests.

## About Purrticles
[Purrticles][p1] is usable as a standalone design and developer tool that can create code and other assets to do with particles. It is easier to use than the XCode particle design interface because it understands field defaults and lets you see just the _Applied_ parameters.

V1.0 is limited to SpriteKit code. 

Purrticles acts as a companion to Touchgram - you can directly copy particle definitions from Purrticles and use in Touchgram v1.3.6 onwards.

## About Touchgram
[Touchgram][tg1] is a platform for creating messages that respond to touch. It's an add-on that dramatically expands what kind of content you can send through iMessage.

It runs on top of SpriteKit and uses particle effects:

1. As feedback to follow where you touch, (eg: flames as you trace a rune) and
2. as effects on composed pages (eg: Snow on a Christmas card).

It's currently available on the [app store for iMessage][tg4].

## Terms and Privacy
A common set of legal terms apply to Touchgram, Purrticles and any other helper tools or associated products we release.

We try very hard to preserve your privacy, so **all use of Touchgram to make content is anonymous.** Apple's iMessage technology helps here - the Touchgram code is not able to see any details identifying who is sending a message or the recipients. 

Our core terms are fairness, just behave decently and don't rip-off other creators. Oh, and create great, weird and gorgeous stuff!
