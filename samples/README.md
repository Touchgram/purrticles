# Purrticles samples

## Playgrounds
The `.swiftpm.zip` files here are examples of using the code exported from Purrticles to make a full Swift Playground document. 

### Matching Apple standard XCode templates
- [Bokeh](Bokeh.swiftpm.zip) using Apple's **Bokeh** texture
- [Fire](Fire.swiftpm.zip) using Apple's **Spark** texture, used in most standard templates
- [Magic](Magic.swiftpm.zip) using Apple's **Spark** texture

### Purrticles templates
- [ConfettiRain](ConfettiRain.swiftpm.zip) like the Apple **Rain** but without a texture, so colored rectangles and using color ranges to make them vary
- [HeartSparks](HeartSparks.swiftpm.zip) using our **Heart** texture
- [MinSprayer](MinSprayer.swiftpm.zip) minimalist sample using no texture so draws colored rectangles


### Downloading
You need to download the zip file first and open it so it expands to create the `.swiftpm` _documents_. (Technically speaking, these are _bundles_ and so look like an entire hierarchy of folders if we just put them up on GitHub without compressing.)

Double-click on the `.zip` files on macOS or open them in the Files app on iPad.

### Using a .swiftpm Playground document
You can open them using the [Swift Playground app][a1] on Mac or iPad.

If you save them to iCloud Drive, they are available in either of the Playground apps.

## Free code export
Code export from Purrticles is a pro feature.

However, if you create a new document from one of our templates, you can export for free providing you **don't change any emitter settings** in that document.

You **can** change the _export settings_ to see what the generated code looks like.

As Purrticles ships with templates to match all the standard Xcode emitters, this means you can create code equivalents of all of them.
